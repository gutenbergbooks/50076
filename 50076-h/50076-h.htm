<p class='c008'>The object of public attention is ever
the sport of public rumour; and truth is
not infrequently affected by the fabrications
of the idle and the ignorant, when men
and things are misrepresented by popular
prejudice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The present armament of Bonaparte
against St. Domingo, and the general alarm
for the safety of our colonial possessions
from the powerful situation of the Brigands
<a id='Page_2'></a>in that island, have occasioned much conjecture,
but produced no authentic information,
while on a subject of such importance
it becomes a duty in those competent
in any degree, to relieve the anxiety
of the public mind. Had Bryan Edwards
lived, we should not so long have fluctuated
in uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c010'>The present writer has by no means
presumed to increase the number of
ephemeral details, as contradictory as
untrue, which have been offered to the
public, of transactions that have now too
long deformed this delightful country. In
the dangerous duties of his profession, the
common accidents of war afforded him a
peculiar opportunity of judging (among
other affairs) of the present state of St.
Domingo, of its defence, and of the character
of its extraordinary Governor.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_3'></a>The events themselves, with the opinions
resulting from them, form, then, the subject
of these pages; and authenticity will supply
the place of the decorations of style.
To preclude, however, the possibility of
doubt, I think it necessary to say thus
much of myself:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Born of a respectable family in the kingdom
of Ireland (where my elder brother,
Counsellor Rainsford, now enjoys the liberal
fortune of our ancestors)<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I early embraced
the military profession, and joined
a regiment under the command of the Earl
of Moira, in which I served during the
American war. Our corps was considerably
employed during two campaigns, and
was in the memorable battles of Camden,
&amp;c. I afterwards unfortunately left
that regiment to enter into a provincial
<a id='Page_4'></a>one, commanded by the late Lord Charles
Montague, and served in Jamaica four
years. On the commencement of the present
war, I went to the continent in the
corps of Royal Fusileers commanded by
Colonel Hardy, and shared its complicated
hardships during the retreat.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_5'></a>I was removed in May, 1795, through
the interest of my inestimable brother-in-law,
General Doyle, to a black corps, to be
raised in the West Indies, under the command
of General Keppel. I went to Barbadoes,
and from thence to Jamaica, where
the corps was to be raised. I arrived on
the 17th of August, and continued on duty
till a severe attack of the yellow fever compelled
my return in his Majesty’s ship,
Sampson. After recovering in England,
at the instance of his Royal Highness the
Duke of York I went to Martinique in
1798, but it not being understood by General
Keppel that his corps was to be levied
there, he ordered me back to Jamaica,
from whence, I found on my arrival, the
officers had sailed for England.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_6'></a>Desirous, as I always am, of being with
my regiment, to facilitate that object I undertook
the mode of returning to Martinique
by beating up to the island of St.
Thomas, an exertion of considerable difficulty
and danger. This, however, I but
little regarded; and Admiral Smith, with
whom I had been long acquainted, kindly
accommodated me in his cabin on board
the Hannibal to the Mole St. Nicholas.
Losing no opportunity of proceeding on
my voyage, I went on board a little
Danish schooner, commanded by Mr.
Frazer.</p>

<p class='c010'>We had not been many days at sea,
when a violent hurricane having dismasted
the vessel, drove us under the walls of Cape
François. Thus unfortunately commenced
the opportunities of obtaining that information
and forming that judgment of the
Present State of St. Domingo, which I am
about to submit to the public. Had I
<a id='Page_7'></a>conceived it possible, at that time, that a
relation of facts respecting that unhappy
country would have become so interesting
to my friends, I might from these opportunities
have collected much respecting it,
and been enabled to communicate what I
collected in a better form.</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus situated, the Brigand boats soon
came out to meet us; and it was recommended
to me, as the only means to prevent
the confiscation of the vessel, and
avoid becoming myself a prisoner of war,
to pass for an American.</p>

<p class='c010'>We were permitted to land at the once
famous city of the Cape; and the first
object that excited our attention amidst
thousands of People of Colour of every
description, was the respectable <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span>
in familiar conversation with two private
Brigands. He very civilly came up to
us—enquired the news—from whence we
<a id='Page_8'></a>came? and our destination. I accommodated
my answers to the occasion, and to
the character I was to support, and complained
of severe treatment from the English!
to which he replied, “<i>Je pense que les
Anglois y sont bien malade à la Mole</i>”—he
believed the English were very sick at the
Mole—and we took our leave.</p>

<p class='c010'>I then retired to the American hotel,
and was introduced to the table d’ hote—to
behold for the first time a <i>perfect system
of equality</i>!</p>

<p class='c010'>Here were officers and privates, the general
and the fifer, at the same table indiscriminately.
I had the honour of sitting
near a fat drummer, who very freely helped
himself from my dish, and addressed me
with frequent repetitions of “<i>A votre Santé
bon Americain</i>.” Here also <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span>
dined, but did not take the head of the
table, from the idea (I was informed) that
<a id='Page_9'></a>no man should be invested with superiority
but in the field. In the evening I went to
the billiard table, where <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span> also
came. Much hilarity prevailed, and his
affability highly increased the satisfaction
of the company. I played with him, and
found nothing to dissipate the pleasure
which the novelty of the scene inspired.
There were several tables in the same
room, at which all played with the same
familiarity with which they dined.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was here informed that a review was
to take place on the following day, in the
plain of the Cape; and desirous of being
present at such a spectacle, I was accompanied
by some Americans, and others of
my own country who resided in the island
under that appellation.</p>

<p class='c010'>In traversing this once superb town,
what a scene of desolation every where
presented itself to my contemplation! On
<a id='Page_10'></a>the site where elegance and luxury had united
all their powers to delight the voluptuary,
remained nothing but ruins. On these
were erected temporary houses for the
American merchants and little shops of the
natives, which but exhibited the devastation
with additional horror. The great
street still contained the walls of many
superb edifices of five and six stories high,
and most beautiful structure; highly-finished
gilt balustrades, in some instances, yet
remained. Nor was this all—in different
parts of the general ruin the skeletons of
their possessors were mingled with the
broken walls—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c001'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“The shelter-seeking peasant rears his shed;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“And, wondering man could want the larger pile,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='small'>“Exults, and owns his cottage with a smile.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Through this dreadful scene I passed to
behold a review, of the real grandeur of
<a id='Page_11'></a>which I had not the least conception.
There were two thousand officers out,
Generals and Ensigns, all carrying arms—yet
with the utmost regularity and attention
to rank—none of that disregard
which had marked the leisure of the
preceding day being the least evident.
Each general officer had a demi-brigade,
which went through the manual exercise
with a degree of expertness I had seldom
before witnessed, and they performed excellently
well several manœuvres applicable
to their method of fighting. At <i>a whistle</i>
a whole brigade ran three or four hundred
yards, and then, separating, threw themselves
flat on the ground, changing to their
backs and sides, and all the time keeping
up a strong fire till recalled—after this they
formed again into their wonted regularity;
and this manœuvre is executed with such
facility and precision, as totally to prevent
cavalry from charging them in bushy and
hilly countries. Indeed, such complete
<a id='Page_12'></a>subordination prevailed, so much promptness
and dexterity, as must astonish an
European who had known any thing of
their previous situation.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the review I returned to the city,
to continue my solitary walk through the
remaining monuments of human ferocity,
and indulge in contemplating the vanity of
all sublunary establishments.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was brooding over scenes where Fancy
herself had once been satiated, when I arrived
at a large square, in the centre of which
was a considerable eminence, and a seat on
the top;—there were two centinels to guard
it—of whom I enquired if I might ascend the
steps? They answered in the affirmative, but
cautioned me not to touch the <i>Cap of Liberty</i>
which crowned it, for it was <span class='sc'>sacred to
Santhonax and Polverel</span>! My curiosity
induced me to ascend; when I perused,
immediately under the cap, a showy inscription
<a id='Page_13'></a>in French, of which I do not
exactly recollect the idiom, not daring to
take a copy, but it was to the following
purport—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='small'>My Friends,</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>We came to make you free.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>The French Nation gives liberty to the World.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>YOU ARE FREE.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>Guard your Freedom.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>Vive la Liberte—Vive la Republique.</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>Vive Robespierre!</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This inscription, I understand, formed a
part of their speech in 1793, when the
Blacks and the Mulattos carried them in
triumph to the Government-House, and
afterwards set fire to the city in eight different
places. They used every woman
with savage barbarity, and then murdered
with the bayonet, man, woman, and
child. Sixty-two thousand inhabitants left
the city. They exterminated the Whites,
<a id='Page_14'></a>and revelled in their cruelty eighteen days!
Such is man when in the possession of
power! and happy would it be for the human
race if the Insurgents of St. Domingo,
so little removed from savage life, were
not countenanced by those who have partaken
of the felicities of civilized society.
Of the carnage that flew through this island
enough has already been said; but it is yet
in the recollection of many Americans,
that the view of the city in flames, the
adjacent sugar works, &amp;c. was the most
dreadful ever beheld.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a long perambulation over these
scenes of former horrors, I returned to the
hotel, but with a mind so much impressed
with what I had seen, that for a considerable
time I could not divest myself of the
most terrible ideas:—my imagination was
haunted with the shades of those who had
fallen, and murdered worth and innocence
were ever before my eyes.——I was also
<a id='Page_15'></a>dissuaded from walking too much, lest by
some observation I might be suspected not
to be an American.</p>

<p class='c010'>For three weeks I continued among
these people; and, except the recollection
of what <i>had</i> been, without any other sacrifice
than my wish to be on duty, and the
necessity of subscribing to every sentiment
hostile to my country, I enjoyed the
amusements and the habits of a capital.
I remained unmolested and comfortable.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the topography of the island, I shall
not retail what is told by those who recite
its history, nor have I ever had leisure to
inspect it. It is, I believe, considered the
richest, as well as the largest of all the islands,
except Cuba; and nature seems to have lavished
on it the advantages which are but
partial in the others. It extends about 400
miles in length, and is more than 70 in
breadth, yet completely peopled. Its natural
<a id='Page_16'></a>defence is unequalled, being entirely
fortified by vast rocks and extensive shoals.
It contains gold (perhaps <i>really the least</i> valuable
of its productions) and the most
charming rivers meander through its variegated
soil.</p>

<p class='c010'>From these reasons, labour is so much
abridged, that no want of leisure is felt
through the pursuits of business, of pleasure,
or of arms. It would be no small
gratification to the feeling heart, to perceive
the peasant in other countries, enjoy
a portion of the ease of the labourer
of St. Domingo.</p>

<p class='c010'>The present productive system seems to
be founded in a reference to first principles.
Every soul employs a certain portion of
their time to labour, which is chiefly agricultural;
and all take the field from a sense
of duty to <i>themselves</i>. A perfect consolidation
appears in all their conduct, and I
<a id='Page_17'></a>never saw a concession in them which did
not come from the heart. I have more
than once seen sixty thousand of them
reviewed, at one time, on the plains of
the Cape, in complete subordination <i>in
the field</i>, and whose united determination
against an invading enemy, would be victory
or death! No coersion is necessary
among them, and it is of course unattempted;
the only punishment inflicted, is
a sense of shame produced by slight confinement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amongst a people thus hardened into
an <i>orderly</i> ferocity—trained from inclination—impenetrably
fortified on the finest
territory on earth, and next to inaccessible
to external attack, what hopes are entertained
of the success of the present armament
I know not; but, whatever might be
expected from a <i>compromise</i> with <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span>,
I feel perfectly convinced no other
means will succeed in the subjugation of St.
<a id='Page_18'></a>Domingo. United as are the blacks and
mulattos, <i>fifty thousand</i> men would ere long
be dissipated in such an attempt; and if
the number now sent against them <i>could</i> be
found sufficient to effect a temporary conquest,
what number of men would continue
to keep them in subjection?</p>

<p class='c010'>And with respect to any views they may
be imagined to contemplate of extending
their possessions, none who know the respectable
state of defence in which our
Islands are kept, will ever entertain the
smallest fear respecting them. Of a territory
the extent of Cuba, I would not hazard
so much, but in the present situation
of our islands, so comparatively small,
possessed by Planters of distinguished
humanity and talent,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> defended by a
<a id='Page_19'></a>militia, prompt on all occasions; with an
army well appointed on their shores, under
<a id='Page_20'></a>the superintendence of ability, experience,
and power at home; and a vigilant navy
round their coasts, the wonder of the world—few
will have sufficient temerity to suggest
that the people I have been describing, will
leave their favourite and favoured island
for the mere purpose of a vain gasconade—and
against those whom I am persuaded
they would rather conciliate as their
friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before I proceed to state the dreadful
occurrence which nearly terminated my
existence, on the island whose unfortunate
situation I have been so candidly describing,
I shall give a sketch of the man
who holds so conspicuous a situation, and
of whom so little is really known.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Toussaint L’ouverture</span>, the present
Commandant of St. Domingo, is one of
those characters, which contentions for
<a id='Page_21'></a>power and the extention of territory, as
well as the jars of individual interest have
not infrequently introduced to astonish the
World.</p>

<p class='c010'>Born a Slave, in which capacity he continued
till the revolution, it is hostile to
<i>received opinions</i> to consider him in any other
light than as a fortunate Brigand; but
chance has directed that the present writer
should be constrained to acknowledge—he
is worthy of imitation as a man—he excites
admiration as a governor—and as a general,
he is yet unsubdued without the probability
of subjection! His regard for the unfortunate
appears the love of human kind; and,
dreaded by different nations, he is the foe
of none.—To the English he is by no
means inimical, and, in possession of many
of the blessings of humanity, he courts the
acceptance of the world.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_22'></a>He is a perfect black, at present about
fifty-five years of age—of a venerable appearance,
but possessed of uncommon discernment.
Of great suavity of manners,
he was not at all concerned in the perpetration
of the massacres, or in the conflagration.</p>

<p class='c010'>He is stiled the <i>General en Chef</i>, and is
always attended by four Aids-de-Camp.
He wears as a uniform, a kind of blue
spencer, with a large red cape falling over
his shoulders, and red cuffs, with eight rows
of lace on his arms, and a pair of large
gold epaulettes thrown back on his
shoulders; a scarlet waistcoat, pantaloons
and half-boots; a round hat with
a red feather and national cockade; and
an extreme large sword is suspended from
his side. He receives a voluntary respect
from every description of his countrymen,
which is more than returned by the
<a id='Page_23'></a>affability of his behaviour, and the goodness
of his heart. Of his civilities to myself, I
have sufficient reason to be proud.</p>

<p class='c010'>I met him frequently, during my stay
in his <i>dominions</i>, and had no occasion of
complaint, even from human errors.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the vessel in which I arrived had
undergone a thorough repair, at the Cape,
we cleared out of the harbour, and I once
more set sail, flushed with hopes of a speedy
arrival at St. Thomas’s; but—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='small'>—“Heav’n from all creatures hides the book of fate.”</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>On the third day after we left the Cape,
our unfortunate vessel sprung a leak, and
we were obliged to put into Fort Dauphine,
now called Fort Egalite, about forty miles
from the Cape.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this situation, the master of the vessel,
<a id='Page_24'></a>as well as myself, apprehended no
danger or impropriety in our going on
shore; and, hoisting Danish colours, we
came to anchor under a small fort. I unthinkingly
landed with the master, and in
less than half an hour was arrested by four
Blacks, and a Mulatto Officer of great
ferocity. They returned with me instantly
on board, and placed two centinels over
me. I was informed that suspicions had
arisen of my being a spy, and that my trial
would be prompt and decisive. On the
morrow I was to be tried <i>and condemned</i>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Under these apprehensions I was to pass
the night, and to prepare for my appearance
before certainly the <i>blackest!</i> tribunal
that ever sat in judgment. I, however,
confined my reflections to the best means
of destroying my baggage, including my military
appointments; which I happily effected
by putting trunks and all out of the
cabin window in the dead of the night,
<a id='Page_25'></a>with a weight attached sufficient to sink
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The silence of the night, interrupted
only by the murmurs of the ocean—the
clamours of the guard, and the distant
sounds from the shore, induced a stronger
degree of melancholy than I, perhaps,
ever experienced.——A confused idea of
my fate, with the <i>shame</i> rather than the
terrors of an ignominious death, revolving
in my mind, deprived me of the possibility
of rest, or the smallest preparation for the
event so soon and so harshly announced.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the morning I was taken before a
black general, named Muro, whose appearance
augured well, for he bore the
principal mythological characteristics of
justice—he was <i>blind of an eye</i>. He interrogated
me, and insisted I was not an
American, but an English spy reconnoitering
the coast. He informed me, that on
<a id='Page_26'></a>the morrow I should be tried by a General
Court Martial—and dismissed me.</p>

<p class='c010'>I was then conducted to a dark prison,
with the usual concomitants of wretchedness,
and treated as one who meditated
some dire plot against the happiness of
their country. I had no bed, nor other
provision but some coarse dry fish which I
could not eat. Next morning, at ten
o’clock, I was regularly brought before a
military court, composed of twelve general
officers.—All I could plead in my behalf
would not avail me, not having the proper
passports, or American certificates; in
fact, my trial <i>was prompt and decisive</i>—I was
condemned to suffer <span class='fss'>DEATH</span> on the next
day!</p>

<p class='c010'>The master of the vessel, poor Frazer,
with great dignity of character and the
most affectionate solicitude, exerted the
utmost of his little power by protesting
<a id='Page_27'></a>against the judgment, and insisting I was
an American—but it was without effect,
and I was remanded to my cell, loaded
with chains, and consigned to misery, till
the sentence of the Court should be transmitted
to <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span>, without whose sanction
it could not be executed.</p>

<p class='c010'>For fourteen days I lay suspended between
life and death, without any other
consolation than the kindness of my gaoler,
whose taciturnity extended to inform me,
every night, I should be <i>hanged</i> on the
next day. To afford me repose, I was
furnished with dried sugar-canes, and was
ill supplied nightly with coarse flesh and
water—the cheering delusions of hope no
longer lightened my imagination, and I
abandoned all human projects for ever.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_28'></a>At the expiration of that period, the
answer of <span class='sc'>Toussaint</span> arrived; but, instead
of confirming my sentence, that truly
great man, although I have since been
convinced <i>he had ascertained the fact</i> of my
<a id='Page_29'></a>being a British Officer, disdained to triumph
over an individual whom misfortune
had thrown in his way. He ordered me
to be released and suffered to proceed on
my voyage, with the greatest magnanimity
adding, “You must never return to this
island, <i>without the proper passports!</i>”</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_30'></a>To describe my feelings on such an unexpected
reverse, would be difficult and
useless. Restored to myself once more,
I did not long remain on a part of the
island where my sufferings would have
tended to efface the agreeable impression
I had received at Cape François; but
cheerfully bidding adieu to this interesting
soil, sailed for St. Thomas’s on the next
day, and very soon reached my long desired
destination, the island of Martinique.</p>

<p class='c010'>On my arrival, I met with a reception
marked with the usual kindness and urbanity
of the commander in chief, General
Cuyler, who ordered me the usual remuneration
for the loss of my baggage. I
am also informed that I was honored with
a congratulatory letter from his Royal
Highness the Duke of York, which from
some unaccountable accident I did not receive.</p>

<p class='c010'><a id='Page_31'></a>Much would remain to be said, were I
to obey a natural impulse; but the pen,
though often a deadly weapon, is one I
am but little accustomed to, I shall therefore
lay it down, at least for the present,
with the confidence that if I have contributed
but little advantage, I have effected
as little injury.</p>

<hr class='c012' />
<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. My eldest sister, now Princess of Monaca, was
married to the late Lieutenant General Doyle.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. In this arduous situation I had the happiness to
effect two orders, which, as they exhibit the hardships
of that period, I subjoin:—Being commanded by my
ever-regretted Colonel to bring up the cloathing of
the troops, I found it only to be effected by cutting
my way with three boats through the ice for twenty
miles. We, however, succeeded, happily, and saved
to Government at least ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another night, during the retreat, twenty-one of
our waggons, with sick and wounded men, arrived
very late at a town called Zwoll, where my corps
was quartered, but were refused admittance by
the Dutch guard, who kept the gate. It was a dreadful
night, and many absolutely died from the cold
of the men under the command of Colonel Drummond
of the Guards. I was ordered to compel their admission,
and effected it; but not till after many
threats, and I had left them three minutes only to
consider, before I should attack them, which in such
a cause, and at such a time, must have been done
with energy.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Notwithstanding it has been of late years the
fashion to consider the character of a planter as derogatory
to humanity, and incapable of being blended
with any of those qualities that ameliorate the condition
of the species, every opportunity which I have
been afforded of judging has tended to convince me
of the contrary. Nothing indeed can be more cruel
than to single out any description of persons for public
reprobation, as best suits the purpose of the fanatic
or the partizan; and nothing is more fatal to the cause
of truth than an implicit reliance on the vague reports
of their enthusiasm, which must inevitably preclude the
possibility of acquiring correct information, or adhering
to facts if produced to their notice.—If the
young and the thoughtless squander the accumulations
of their ancestors, it is certainly no evidence of
general voluptuousness.—If there be circumstances
exceptionable in the conduct of the Slave Trade, does it
follow that the planter is a merciless executioner?
certainly not—it would be hostile to his interest, and
inexpedient in his situation.—As merchants and
as men, many are highly and extensively esteemed
and regarded; and instances of affection and regret in
the slaves they have been described to torture, are
neither infrequent nor unrecorded.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c010'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. I cannot omit here to pay the tribute of gratitude
to a poor unknown Female of Colour, whose
pity, more extensive than her power, would have
alleviated the horrors of my situation. She came occasionally
in the night to the window of my cell,
which looked into a court to which she found access
by an avenue that was unguarded. She brought me
food, and wine or spirits, the remains of which, to
prevent enquiry, she was anxious should be destroyed.
The humane sympathy expressed by her in these nocturnal
offerings to misery, have repeatedly brought to
my remembrance the eulogium of Lediard on a sex
ever prone to tender offices. In compliment to my
humble benefactor I quote the passage, and heartily
subscribe to the sentiments:—</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have,” says he, “always remarked that
women, in all countries, are civil, obliging, tender,
and humane: that they are ever inclined to be gay
and cheerful, timorous and modest; and that they do
not hesitate, like men, to perform a kind or generous
action.—Not haughty, nor arrogant, not supercilious,
they are full of courtesy, and fond of society—more
liable in general to err than man, but in general, also,
more virtuous, and performing more good actions
than he. To a woman, whether civilized or savage,
I never addressed myself in the language of decency
and friendship—without receiving a decent and
friendly answer—with man it has often been otherwise.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In wandering over the barren plains of inhospitable
Denmark, through honest Sweden, and frozen
Lapland, rude and churlish Finland, unprincipled
Russia, and the wide-spread regions of the wandering
Tartar,—if hungry, dry, cold, wet, or sick, the
women have ever been friendly to me, and uniformly
so; and to add to this virtue, (so worthy of the appellation
of benevolence,) these actions have been
performed in so free and so kind a manner, that if I
was thirsty, I drank the sweetest draught, and if
hungry, I ate the coarse meal with a double relish.”</p>
